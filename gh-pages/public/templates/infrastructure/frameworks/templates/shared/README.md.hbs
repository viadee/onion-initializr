# Onion Architecture Project

This project was generated using [Onion-Initializr](https://github.com/viadee/onion-initializr).

It follows the Onion Architecture pattern and contains a minimal working version of your application. You can continue developing analog to the existing project scaffolding.

## Getting Started

This project is a working minimal application that you can start immediately.

### Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available on localhost with the port shown in your terminal output.

You can test if everything is working by opening your browser and navigating to the displayed URL.
Click on the button "Run Use Case". The text below the button should show "use case executed âœ…".
Now you can be sure that the dependency injection is working and the project is set up correctly.




## Adding New Services and Entities

You can add new services and entities manually by following the existing project structure, or use the Onion-Initializr CLI for automated generation.

### Using the CLI Tool

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g onion-initializr
```

Then use it to generate new files:

```bash
onion
```
